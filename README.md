# CloudCast 🌤️🌧️

A simple weather website which uses the [Open Meteo](https://open-meteo.com) API to provide weather data for anywhere in the world. This project is based on a tutorial from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Reny0cTTv24), with some modifications and improvements made by me.
